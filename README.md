# SoulsborneCalulator
# After looking for way to quickly calculate how many souls you need to get from one specific level to another, I found nothing online. Everything had to be done by hand using the souls formula found before, so I created a quick calculator that can be done for any fromsoftware game using python
# I plan to make a full fledged website, but my skills are a bit far from that, so this is my first project to learn how to get into that!
# The txt file for DS2 must be downloaded, because there is no availabe formula used for DS2. The program will take the values provided and turn them into a list, which is then used to determine the total amount of souls needed in DS2.
# If you see any errors or could offer some improvements, please do.
# Update: I have turned this into a full fledged website, but will be keeping this code up as a way to show where I started this project
